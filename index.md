## Overview
I am a senior software project manager and solutions architect specializing in AI-powered digital
health, regulated platforms, and complex cloud integrations.

My work spans end-to-end delivery: from requirements and architecture through implementation,
clinical validation, privacy and security governance, and production rollout. I have led iOS and
Android healthcare applications involving on-device AI (rPPG / computer vision), Bluetooth medical
device integrations, secure mobile platforms, and enterprise-grade cloud systems.

This site serves as a **professional evidence hub** showcasing delivery artifacts, governance
documentation, and validation work for B2B collaborations, regulated projects, and consulting
engagements.
