## Overview
I am a senior software project manager and solutions architect specializing in AI-powered digital
health, regulated platforms, and complex cloud integrations.

My work spans end-to-end delivery: from requirements and architecture through implementation,
clinical validation, privacy and security governance, and production rollout. I have led iOS and
Android healthcare applications involving on-device AI (rPPG / computer vision), Bluetooth medical
device integrations, secure mobile platforms, and enterprise-grade cloud systems.

This site serves as a **professional evidence hub** showcasing delivery artifacts, governance
documentation, and validation work for B2B collaborations, regulated projects, and consulting
engagements.

## Evidence & governance highlights

- Clinical validation program for App Store readiness (Apple guideline 1.4.1): hospital collaboration, protocols, reproducible analysis, and evidence dossier.
- Privacy & AI governance: on-device AI processing; no camera media upload/storage; platform-specific retention rules and provenance labeling (AI / Device / Manual).
- Security controls: EU/EEA hosting (Hetzner, Germany) under GDPR DPA; HTTPS/TLS in transit; application-layer AES-256 at rest; RBAC / need-to-know access.
- Data subject rights & operational controls: consent management (incl. SSN consent for purchase flows), item-level deletion with cross-device sync, and account deletion workflows.


## Areas of focus

- AI-powered mobile and cloud platforms (healthcare & wellness)
- Regulated environments (GDPR, security, validation, governance)
- End-to-end SDLC and cross-functional delivery
