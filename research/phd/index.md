## Summary
- Focus: Electronic-structure and vibrational properties of Jahn–Teller-active systems and related molecular species, combining experiment and computation.
- Experimental work: Laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and laser-excited, dispersed fluorescence (LEDF) spectroscopy of alkoxy radicals (1-propoxy, 1-butoxy, 2-propoxy, 2-butoxy) to extract vibronic separations (ground X̃ and low-lying Ã states) and vibrational frequencies.
- Theory-guided spectral analysis: Extensive *ab initio*/DFT calculations for Ag<sub>3</sub> (silver trimer) and the tropyl radical (C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>7</sub>) to predict Ã–X̃ spectra, estimate Jahn–Teller parameters, and support band assignments via simulated absorption/emission spectra.
- Weakly bound complexes: Theoretical study of decaborane (B<sub>10</sub>H<sub>14</sub>) interactions with I<sup>−</sup> and Xe, comparing binding mechanisms (electrostatic/induction/dispersion) and charge-transfer characteristics.
- Chapter map (high level): Ch.2 decaborane complexes; Ch.3 alkoxy-radical emission spectra; Ch.4 Ag<sub>3</sub> *ab initio*; Ch.5 Ag<sub>3</sub> LIF/LEDF analysis; Ch.6 tropyl-radical LIF/LEDF; final chapter conclusions.

## Transferable skills (PM / Solutions Architect)
- Evidence-driven problem framing and methodology design across multiple workstreams (experimental spectroscopy + computational modeling).
- Model-to-data calibration: iterative fitting cycles, simulation/validation loops, and uncertainty estimation for key parameters.
- Tooling & workflow engineering: building analysis pipelines that compare experimental vs simulated outputs and speed up iteration.
- Decision-making under constraints: selecting and benchmarking methods to balance accuracy, interpretability, and computational cost.
- Data quality & measurement rigor: calibration, digitization, and repeatable processing workflows for experimental datasets.
- Technical communication: translating complex work into structured documentation and clear summaries for different audiences.
