## Summary
- Focus: Electronic-structure and vibrational properties of Jahn-Teller-active systems and related molecular species, combining experiment and computation.
- Experimental work: Laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and laser-excited, dispersed fluorescence (LEDF) spectroscopy of alkoxy radicals (1-propoxy, 1-butoxy, 2-propoxy, 2-butoxy) to extract vibronic separations (ground X and low-lying A states) and vibrational frequencies.
- Theory-guided spectral analysis: Extensive ab initio/DFT calculations for Ag3 (silver trimer) and the tropyl radical (C7H7) to predict A-X spectra, estimate Jahn-Teller parameters, and support band assignments via simulated absorption/emission spectra.
- Weakly bound complexes: Theoretical study of decaborane (B10H14) interactions with I- and Xe, comparing binding mechanisms (electrostatic/induction/dispersion) and charge-transfer characteristics.
- Chapter map (high level): Ch.2 decaborane complexes; Ch.3 alkoxy-radical emission spectra; Ch.4 Ag3 ab initio; Ch.5 Ag3 LIF/LEDF analysis; Ch.6 tropyl-radical LIF/LEDF; final chapter conclusions.
