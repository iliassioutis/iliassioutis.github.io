I use Agile/Scrum as an execution system for predictable iteration, fast feedback, and stakeholder alignment — while still keeping delivery traceable and governed (especially in regulated or integration-heavy work).

---

## How I run Scrum in practice

**Backlog & priorities**
- Maintain a single prioritised backlog (features, defects, tech debt, risks)
- Write work as user stories (or tasks) with clear acceptance criteria
- Keep dependencies visible and actively managed

**Core ceremonies (lightweight but disciplined)**
- Backlog refinement: clarify scope, split work, confirm acceptance criteria
- Sprint planning: commit to a realistic goal and scope
- Daily sync: remove blockers, protect flow
- Review/demo: validate outcomes with stakeholders
- Retro: capture improvements and turn them into actions

**Delivery tracking**
- Use simple, repeatable metrics:
  - delivery predictability (planned vs done)
  - cycle time / lead time (where feasible)
  - defect trends and escaped defects
- Keep a RAID log even in Agile when risk is non-trivial

---

## How I adapt Agile in real environments
- **Regulated / high-risk**: add explicit quality gates (privacy/security review, release readiness checks)
- **Vendor dependencies**: plan integration milestones and contract-level deliverables
- **Multiple stakeholders**: align via clear decision paths (RACI), not endless meetings

---

## Typical Agile artifacts I maintain
- Product backlog + sprint backlog
- Definition of Done and acceptance criteria templates
- RAID log (risks, assumptions, issues, dependencies)
- Release plan and environment readiness checklist
- SIT/UAT plan (when needed)
