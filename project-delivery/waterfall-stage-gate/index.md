I use Waterfall/stage-gate when sequential planning and formal approvals reduce risk — typically with regulated constraints, fixed integration dependencies, or when stakeholders require structured sign-offs.

## When stage-gate fits best
- External integrations or vendors with fixed timelines
- Hardware/device integration constraints
- Compliance-driven delivery where evidence and approvals are required
- High cost of rework (late changes are expensive)

## How I structure stage-gate delivery

**Gate 0 — Initiation**
- Scope, objectives, constraints, stakeholders, success measures
- Initial RAID and delivery plan

**Gate 1 — Requirements sign-off**
- BRD/FRD (or equivalent) and acceptance criteria
- Traceability approach (requirements → tests → release)

**Gate 2 — Design sign-off**
- Architecture, interfaces, data flows
- Security/privacy considerations (where relevant)
- Test strategy and release plan

**Gate 3 — Build complete**
- Feature complete vs scope baseline
- Integration checkpoints met; known issues triaged

**Gate 4 — Verification & validation**
- SIT/UAT execution, defect closure criteria
- Evidence pack and readiness checklist

**Gate 5 — Release & handover**
- Go-live runbook, rollback plan, monitoring plan
- Support handover and hypercare window

## Key principle
Even in stage-gate, I aim to deliver in smaller increments where possible — it reduces risk and makes stakeholder feedback cheaper.
