This page summarises the practical artifacts and governance controls I use to keep delivery aligned, transparent, and auditable — across both Agile and stage-gate delivery.

---

## Core delivery artifacts
- **BRD / FRD** (or equivalent): what we are building and why
- **User stories / requirements + acceptance criteria**
- **Solution notes**: architecture/integration decisions, data flows
- **Test strategy**: SIT/UAT scope, responsibilities, entry/exit criteria
- **Release plan**: environments, rollout steps, rollback, comms

---

## Governance tools I use repeatedly
- **RAID log**: risks, assumptions, issues, dependencies (kept current)
- **RACI**: who owns decisions and deliverables
- **Change control**: scope changes tracked, assessed, approved (or rejected)
- **Quality gates**: readiness checks before UAT and release

---

## Testing & release governance
- SIT/UAT plans + test evidence (where appropriate)
- Defect triage approach and severity definitions
- Release readiness checklist (feature complete, test complete, risks accepted/mitigated)
- Go-live runbook + rollback plan + hypercare plan

---

## What recruiters usually mean by “strong governance”
- predictable cadence and reporting
- clear ownership of decisions
- traceability from requirements to outcomes
- controlled releases and responsible change management
