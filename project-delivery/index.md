This section explains how I deliver projects in practice — across SDLC, Agile/Scrum, and Waterfall/stage-gate — and the governance/artifacts I use to keep execution predictable and auditable.

## How I apply these methods

I do not claim formal PM certifications. Instead, these pages document the **hands-on delivery practices** I apply in real projects — the same concepts that appear in many certification frameworks — with concrete, repeatable ways of working.

- **SDLC in practice:** how I take work from discovery and requirements through build, testing, release, and production support — with clear outputs at each step.
- **Agile & Scrum:** how I run iterative delivery (backlog, sprint cadence, ceremonies, tracking, and stakeholder alignment) while keeping scope and quality controlled.
- **Waterfall / stage-gate:** how I manage sequential delivery when it fits better (regulated constraints, fixed dependencies, or integration-heavy programs), using gates and sign-offs.
- **Artifacts & governance:** the documents, controls, and checkpoints that make delivery traceable — including privacy/security gates and AI governance where applicable.
