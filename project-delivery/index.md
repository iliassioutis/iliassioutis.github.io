This section explains how I deliver projects in practice — across SDLC, Agile/Scrum, and Waterfall/stage-gate — and the governance/artifacts I use to keep execution predictable and auditable.

## Pages

- 🧩 **SDLC in practice**  
  How I run discovery → build → test → release → support, with traceable artifacts.  
  🔎 <a href="/project-delivery/sdlc/">Open SDLC page</a>

- 🔁 **Agile & Scrum**  
  How I manage backlog, ceremonies, delivery tracking, and stakeholder alignment.  
  🔎 <a href="/project-delivery/agile-scrum/">Open Agile/Scrum page</a>

- 🧱 **Waterfall / stage-gate**  
  Where sequential delivery fits (regulated constraints, integration dependencies) and how I keep governance tight.

- 🧾 **Artifacts & governance**  
  BRD/FRD, RAID, RACI, SIT/UAT, change control, release readiness, privacy/security gates, evidence packs.
