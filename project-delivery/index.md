This section explains how I deliver projects in practice — across SDLC, Agile/Scrum, and Waterfall/stage-gate — and the governance/artifacts I use to keep execution predictable and auditable.

## How I apply these methods

These pages describe the delivery approach I use to take initiatives from idea to production — with clear roles, artifacts, checkpoints, and measurable outcomes. The focus is practical: what I do, what I produce, and how I keep delivery controlled, transparent, and audit-ready where needed.

- **SDLC in practice**  
  How I run end-to-end delivery from discovery to operations, with traceability throughout:  
  - Define scope, goals, success metrics, constraints, and stakeholders; establish roles and decision-making paths.  
  - Turn needs into requirements (functional + non-functional), acceptance criteria, and a delivery plan (phases, milestones, dependencies, risks).  
  - Translate requirements into solution design (architecture, integration points, data flows, security/privacy constraints).  
  - Execute build with disciplined versioning and environments (dev/test/stage/prod), plus structured reviews and quality checks.  
  - Plan and run testing as a progression (component → integration → system), and support readiness for SIT/UAT and go-live.  
  - Drive release readiness (go/no-go), rollout strategy, monitoring, incident triage, and post-release stabilization.  
  - Close with lessons learned, documentation updates, and a prioritized improvement backlog.

- **Agile & Scrum**  
  How I deliver iteratively while keeping scope, quality, and stakeholder expectations under control:  
  - Maintain a prioritized backlog aligned to goals and value; keep items “ready” with clear acceptance criteria.  
  - Set a delivery cadence (sprints), define a realistic sprint goal, and plan based on team capacity and dependencies.  
  - Run the core ceremonies with purpose (refinement, planning, daily sync, review/demo, retrospective) and capture actions.  
  - Track progress and risks transparently (burn-up/down, flow, blockers), and intervene early when delivery deviates.  
  - Keep stakeholders aligned through demos, releases, and clear change handling (trade-offs, scope adjustments, sequencing).  
  - Use “definition of done” and quality gates so increments are potentially shippable and not just “code complete.”  
  - Blend Agile delivery with governance when needed (e.g., regulated environments, privacy/security reviews, release approvals).

- **Waterfall / stage-gate**  
  How I use sequential delivery when requirements, constraints, or dependencies make staged execution the safer option:  
  - Break work into phases with explicit entry/exit criteria (e.g., requirements complete, design signed off, test evidence ready).  
  - Control scope and change through formal impact assessment (schedule/cost/risk), approvals, and re-baselining when required.  
  - Manage dependencies and vendor integration with detailed plans, interface specifications, and coordinated test windows.  
  - Use stage reviews for governance: quality checks, security/privacy readiness, operational readiness, and go/no-go decisions.  
  - Emphasize documentation, traceability, and audit-friendly evidence where the domain demands it.  
  - Preserve feedback loops via checkpoints and controlled iteration inside phases (so “stage-gate” isn’t rigid or blind).

- **Artifacts & governance**  
  The documentation and controls I use to keep delivery traceable, predictable, and compliant where applicable:  
  - Requirements and specifications: BRD/FRD, user stories/use cases, non-functional requirements, acceptance criteria.  
  - Planning and control: roadmap, milestones, RAID log, RACI, estimates, dependency mapping, stakeholder comms plan.  
  - Quality and testing: test strategy, SIT/UAT plans, test evidence, defect triage, release notes, operational runbooks.  
  - Change and release: change requests, impact analysis, release readiness checklist, rollout/backout plan, post-release review.  
  - Privacy & security gates: data classification, access controls, encryption approach, retention/deletion considerations, DPIA-style thinking when needed.  
  - **AI governance (when AI is involved):** claims boundaries, transparency and provenance, human oversight where needed, validation/evidence artifacts, monitoring, and clear documentation of what the system does (and does not) do.
