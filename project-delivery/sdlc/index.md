I use SDLC as a practical delivery backbone: clear phases, clear outputs, and traceability from requirements to release. Depending on context, phases may run sequentially (stage-gate) or iteratively (Agile).

---

## How I apply SDLC (end-to-end)

1) **Discovery & alignment**
- Define problem statement, stakeholders, success metrics, constraints (time/budget/compliance)
- Confirm scope boundaries and interfaces (systems, devices, vendors)

Typical outputs:
- Vision / scope summary
- Stakeholder map, high-level roadmap
- Initial risks and assumptions (RAID)

2) **Requirements**
- Workshops to capture functional + non-functional requirements
- Define acceptance criteria and data flows (including privacy/security constraints where relevant)

Typical outputs:
- BRD/FRD (or equivalent)
- User stories + acceptance criteria
- Process flows, data flow diagrams, integration notes

3) **Solution design**
- Translate requirements into architecture and delivery plan
- Define integration contracts and operational behaviors (logging, monitoring, support)

Typical outputs:
- Solution architecture / integration design
- API/interface specs (as applicable)
- Test strategy and release plan outline

4) **Build & integration**
- Execute delivery in increments, tracking dependencies and risks
- Coordinate engineering, QA, product, stakeholders, vendors

Typical outputs:
- Working increments + release notes
- Updated backlog / plan, dependency log
- Environments readiness checklist

5) **Testing & validation**
- SIT/UAT planning and execution; defect triage; regression control
- Evidence capture in regulated contexts (what was tested, how, outcomes)

Typical outputs:
- SIT/UAT plans, test cases, test reports
- Defect log + triage outcomes
- Release readiness checklist / go-live sign-off notes

6) **Release & rollout**
- Controlled rollout + communications; rollback plan; monitoring
- Post-release stabilization and handover

Typical outputs:
- Go-live runbook, rollback plan
- Monitoring/alerts checklist
- Hypercare plan and support handover

7) **Operate & improve**
- Measure outcomes, gather feedback, prioritize improvements
- Run retrospectives/post-mortems when needed

Typical outputs:
- Post-release review
- Backlog of improvements
- Updated risks/controls

## When SDLC “shape” changes
- **Agile** when we benefit from fast feedback and iterative learning
- **Stage-gate** when governance, external dependencies, or compliance require controlled approvals
