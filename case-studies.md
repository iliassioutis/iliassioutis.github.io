## Featured case studies

### 🧪 Clinical validation — ePokratis MedAiConnect (iOS)
One-month clinical validation study at **Athens Hospital** (**Feb 6–Mar 6, 2025**) with **27 adults (20–91)** evaluating **accuracy, reliability, and data integrity** for **six Bluetooth medical devices** integrated with the ePokratis MedAiConnect **iOS** app, supporting App Store safety evidence under **Guideline 1.4.1 (Safety – Physical Harm)**. Athens Hospital clinical staff supervised measurements and **cross-verified that app-displayed values matched the device outputs**.

- **Devices validated:** TaiDoc TD-3128 (BP/PR), TD-8255 (SpO₂/PR), TD-1241 (Thermometer), TD-2555 (Scale), Contec PM10 (ECG/HR), TaiDoc TD-4216B (biomarkers).
- **Protocol:** paired comparison vs **hospital-grade reference standards**; **3× repeats per participant** for vital-sign devices; TD-4216B subset: **23/27** blood samples, **3× repeats per biomarker** with **single clinical reference per biomarker** (invasive sampling constraint).
- **Reference standards (Athens Hospital):** Omron HEM-907XL (BP), Nellcor bedside SpO₂ system, Welch Allyn Braun ThermoScan PRO 6000 (temperature), Seca 769 medical scale (weight), Philips PageWriter TC20 ECG system, Roche Cobas c 111 lab analyzer (biomarkers) — all certified and clinically operated.
- **Methods:** **ICC** (Pingouin; **ICC3 / ICC3k**), **MAD**, **Agreement %**, and **Bland–Altman** (mean difference and **95% limits of agreement: LOA = MD ± 1.96×SD**) with clinically/standard-derived thresholds (e.g., ISO 81060-2 for BP, ISO 15197 for glucose).
- **Key outcomes (study summary tables):** vital-sign devices showed **excellent reliability** (ICC3 **0.975–0.9999**; ICC3k **0.992–0.99997**); TD-4216B biomarkers ranged **very good to excellent** (ICC3 **0.889–0.997**, ICC3k **0.960–0.999**). Regulatory/clinical thresholds were defined per measure and summarized as ‘Met in study: Yes’ in the report’s compliance table.
- **Data integrity:** end-to-end workflow verified; **no missing values, no corruption, consistent units/labels/timestamps**, and **100% in-app match** to device readings across all devices (no integrity issues observed).

### 🧠 UCL MPhil thesis — 3D non-rigid registration for image-guided interventions (prostate)
Research project at **UCL** benchmarking **non-rigid point-set registration** (TPS-based warps) for prostate surface alignment under **occlusion/partial overlap**, **noise**, and **outliers**, using **synthetic datasets** and **Target Registration Error (TRE)** (including evaluation **beyond common overlap**).

### 📊 DHL Management (MBA Internship) — GCS FACTs: finance data validation & forecasting automation (confidential)

*Confidentiality note: customer identifiers, internal contacts, and intranet-only details are omitted. This summary focuses on the validation workflow, analytics approach, and deliverables described in the thesis.*

#### Context
This MBA research project (Cass Business School, 2009) was initiated by **GCS senior management** to improve **monthly validation** of large customer datasets across **regions** (EMEA, Americas, AP) and multiple **business units (BUs)**. The goal was to strengthen quality control for customer reporting (e.g., **revenue, profitability, volume, A/R, and related cost views**) in a complex, BU-specific systems landscape.

#### Problem
Validation during monthly close was slow and error-prone:
- Large volumes of data were validated by many people, increasing the risk of **human error**.
- Failed validations often led to long internal discussions about **where** an issue occurred in the process and **how** to correct it.
- Processes differed by BU and region, and data often had to be reconciled across **system extracts** and **Excel-based files**.

#### Research approach
- **Secondary research:** internal/non-public sources to map the organization, reporting concepts, and data landscape.
- **Primary research:** structured interviews across time zones over ~two months and creation of detailed **Excel master files** documenting customer data sources and content by **BU / country / region**.

#### Validation workflow (documented in the thesis)
Two operational variants were described:

- **Excel-file-based validation (regional-led):**
  - regional finance teams extract data from BU source systems and compare them against BU-provided Excel files
  - create a master dataset, validate completeness and consistency, and upload pre-close validated data into a contributor environment
  - global consolidation and additional checks follow before final reporting

- **Contributor-based validation (global-led):**
  - the global team extracts and loads customer data directly to the contributor environment
  - corrections are applied using BU Excel inputs; regional teams can then add adjustments
  - similar pre-close / final-close checks follow through to reporting outputs

#### What was built (Excel/VBA analytics automation)
Because Excel was the practical platform used by the finance organization, statistical models were implemented in **Excel with VBA** to support validation and analysis.

- **FREIGHT model (time-series validation & forecasting)**
  - short-horizon forecasting using **moving averages (MA2 / MA3)**
  - forecast error tracked via **MAD (mean absolute deviation)**
  - time-series breakdown outputs (trend + seasonal proxy + residuals) where data sufficiency allowed
  - validation-month checking using **standard deviation–based logic**
  - automated generation of a monthly **validation report** (sample report referenced in appendices)

- **EXPRESS model (driver-based validation)**
  - modeled **revenue vs operational drivers** (e.g., weight and shipments) using regression (simple / multiple)
  - model diagnostics including **R² / adjusted R²**, coefficient significance (p-values), residual checks, and **Durbin–Watson** autocorrelation testing
  - automated summary tables and plots to support investigation of conspicuous data

#### Outcome (business value described)
- Improved visibility into validation steps and data-flow dependencies at BU/region/global levels.
- Enabled more systematic identification of **conspicuous data**, **outliers**, and **inconsistencies** during pre-close and final-close validation.
- Provided a repeatable analytics foundation in a toolset (Excel/VBA) aligned with how the finance teams operated.
