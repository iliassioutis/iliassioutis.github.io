## Featured case studies

### 🧪 Clinical validation — ePokratis MedAiConnect (iOS)
One-month observational study at **Athens Hospital** (**Feb 6–Mar 6, 2025**) with **27 adult participants (20–91)** validating **six Bluetooth medical devices** integrated with the iOS app. Hospital clinical staff supervised measurements and **cross-verified that app-displayed readings matched device outputs**, ensuring accuracy and data integrity.:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

- **Devices:** TaiDoc TD-3128 (BP), TD-8255 (SpO₂/PR), TD-1241 (Thermometer), TD-2555 (Scale), Contec PM10 (ECG), TaiDoc TD-4216B (multi-biomarker).:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
- **Protocol:** For the five vital-sign devices, each device measurement was paired with a **hospital-grade reference measurement** and **repeated 3× per participant**. For TD-4216B, **23/27 participants provided blood samples**; device readings were **3× per biomarker**, with a single clinical reference per biomarker (due to the invasive nature of sampling).:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
- **Statistics & evidence methods:** reliability via **ICC**, accuracy via **MAD** and **Agreement %** (with biomarker thresholds explicitly defined, e.g., glucose aligned to **ISO 15197:2013**), plus **Bland–Altman** bias/95% limits of agreement (±1.96 SD) with plots generated from the reproducibility scripts.:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
- **Data governance:** datasets were **pseudonymized (GDPR Art. 4(5))** and de-identification keys retained only by Athens Hospital.:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
- **Transmission integrity:** app/device values were cross-validated during testing; clinical personnel verified alignment, and the report includes data-transmission integrity checks (e.g., TD-4216B describes 100% successful transmission and verified accuracy).:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}
