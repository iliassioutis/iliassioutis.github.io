## Featured case studies

### 🧪 Clinical validation — ePokratis MedAiConnect (iOS)
Hospital observational study (Athens Hospital; Feb 6–Mar 6, 2025) validating **accuracy, reliability, and data integrity** for six Bluetooth medical devices integrated with the iOS app. Measurements were clinically supervised with app reading cross-verification, and used a repeat-measures protocol (typically 3 repeats per participant/device; biomarker subset included blood sampling). Statistical methodology included Bland–Altman (bias/limits of agreement), ICC (reliability), MAD, and agreement-percentage metrics with clinically justified fixed thresholds (e.g., BP ±5 mmHg; pulse ±3 bpm), aligned to relevant standards/guidance; analysis was performed on pseudonymized datasets with informed consent.
